> A `repo` which can only be completed by lots and lots of contributions !

# What is it ?

Simply, It's a **Public** `repository` which holds various **Institutions Logo**.

# But, Why ?

* Ever completed an **edX Course** ?
* Felt blessed and thought to *share* the **Holly Molly Experience** ? 
* Are you a **Blogger** ?

**Even worse, If you have done two courses, probably  you didn't added a cover logo! You got me ? :wink:**
