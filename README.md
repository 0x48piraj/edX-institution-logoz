**We want to collect all edX mooc Logo's !**

> A small step of yours can be a great leap for this Project :blush: 

If you ever have **completed an edX Course and got a `certificate`** then, this is a piece of cake :cake:  for you !

You can easily find the correct **logo-dimensions** by _copying_ the **image** `url` on `https://courses.edx.org/certificates/your_certid`

#### Just collect as many logo's you have or you can & put them on the `logoz` folder and fire a **pull request**

> All the **valid pull requests** will be _quickly_ **approved**  :smile:
